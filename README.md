# Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation Model

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for developing a model that accurately recognizes food items from images and estimates their calorie content. The goal is to enable users to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices.

## Features

- **Food Recognition:** The model utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to identify various food items in images.
  
- **Calorie Estimation:** The model estimates the calorie content of recognized food items, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of their dietary intake.

- **User-friendly Interface:** Integrate the model into applications or services with ease to empower users to track their food consumption effortlessly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pipenv for managing dependencies (`pip install pipenv`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arijit258/food-recognition.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd food-recognition
   ```

3. Install dependencies using Pipenv:

   ```bash
   pipenv install
   ```


## Usage

1. Upload an image containing food items to the application.

2. The model will recognize the food items in the image.

3. The application will display the recognized food items along with their estimated calorie content.

4. Users can use this information to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices.

## Model Training

If you wish to train the model with custom data or fine-tune it for specific food categories, refer to the `train_model` directory. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file within that directory for guidance on training the model.
